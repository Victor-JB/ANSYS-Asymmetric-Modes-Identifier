Had to create a venv running python 3.10.00 because wouldn't work on higher versions
Created venv, activated it
Ran pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
Installed pip install numpy and pip install cython first because of errors given
Then ran pip install ansys-mapdl-core ansys-mapdl-reader
And it worked!
