Figure out how to get python running pymapdl and the analysis
View an example of the sim in ParaVisualizer sim
BE ABLE TO PARAMETERIZE THE STUFF--super important for repeated sim
FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANALYZE FORCE GENERATED of a thing--HARMONIC ANALYSIS?
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT IN DATASET FOR ML--HOW TO ACTUALLY TRAIN A THING, the inputs and outputs

run_modal_basic.py (base file):
Runs a modal analysis on one beam, extracts frequency, and saves the mode shape as a .vtk.

ðŸ”¹ beam_generator.py:
Builds beams of variable size (parametric generation).

ðŸ”¹ modal_analysis.py:
Handles solving and postprocessing (mode shapes + frequencies).

ðŸ”¹ symmetry_check.py:
Uses NumPy to classify whether a mode is symmetric or asymmetric.

ðŸ”¹ dataset_builder.py (later):
Loops through beams and builds a dataset.



âœ… Fix MAPDL path
ðŸ§ª Test the beam + modal solve
ðŸ§  Extract asymmetric mode shape
ðŸ’¥ Run harmonic or static analysis to get actual deformation + force output
ðŸ§  Use this for your machine learning dataset
