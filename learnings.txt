But What Does Modal Analysis Actually Do?
Important: You are not applying an external force at all
In modal analysis:

You do not apply loads

You ask ANSYS to find:

The natural frequencies and shapes the system would vibrate in if excited

It solves this eigenvalue problem:

[𝐾−𝜔2𝑀]
𝜙=0
[K−ω 2M]
ϕ=0
Where:
K is the stiffness matrix
M is the mass matrix
ω are natural frequencies
𝜙, ϕ are the mode shapes

About different simulators:
FEA (structural modal)
If your only interest is the structural natural frequencies and mode shapes of the solid 
McKibben bladder (treated as a linear or prestressed elastic body), then classical FEA in 
ANSYS Mechanical / MAPDL is exactly the right tool. Once you’ve done your static inflation 
step you can extract eigenmodes efficiently.

CFD / Fluid–Structure Interaction
If you need to capture the dynamics of the pressurizing fluid (e.g. wave propagation inside 
the tube, fluid inertia, acoustic coupling) then you need a coupled FSI or at least an 
acoustic–structural analysis. That is much heavier: you’d discretize the air volume, choose 
an acoustic element, or else run a transient CFD + structural solve.

Differentiable simulators
If your end goal is “embed the physics inside a neural‐network training loop,” there are 
emerging frameworks (e.g. JAX‐FEM, DiffTaichi) that let you backprop through FEA. Commercial 
ANSYS isn’t differentiable out of the box. But if you just want to generate a large offline 
dataset of mode shapes and frequencies, then train your own model, you don’t strictly need a 
differentiable solver.

The .vtk file created by mapdl.result.save_as_vtk(...) is an unstructured grid containing:

📌 Nodal positions (the mesh)
🧭 Vector fields like nodal displacement
🎨 Scalar fields like node number, magnitude of displacement
🧠 Metadata about elements and node IDs

Yes, VTK files contain meshing information. 
They store the geometry (point coordinates) and topology (connectivity of elements) of a mesh. 
Essentially, a VTK file defines how a mesh is structured, including the arrangement of points 
and how they are connected to form elements like triangles, tetrahedra, etc. 

It's designed for use in:

ParaView (visualization)

PyVista / VTK in Python (manipulation)

Machine learning pipelines (as NumPy arrays)

4. Manipulating .vtk in ParaView – Quick Tips
Once you open a mode shape .vtk:

// PARAVIEW FILTERS
🔧 Useful Filters
Filter	Purpose
Warp By Vector	Visualize mode shape deformation
Calculator	Compute magnitude, apply math ops
Clip / Slice	View interior or mirror planes
Glyph	Show vector arrows (displacement)
Extract Points	Export points as CSV/VTK subset

// MODAL REACTION FORCE
What You Actually Want: Modal Reaction Force at Beam End
Since you're interested in:
💡 “How much force does the beam deliver to the object it’s embedded in when vibrating?”
You want to compute:
The reaction force at one or both ends
In response to a unit modal displacement scaled by a known amplitude

HOW TO PROPERLY RENDER VTK
Step 2: See the Mesh
To show the actual mesh triangulation:

In the top toolbar, click “Wireframe” from the dropdown (next to Surface)

Or go to the Properties panel, find Representation → set to Wireframe

You’ll now see the finite element grid

✅ This shows:

Element density (from meshing)

Node connectivity

Triangulation (for surface plots)

How complex your model was discretized

🧠 Optional: Show Node Numbers
In Properties panel, scroll to “Labels”

Check “Point Labels”

From the dropdown, select Point ID (or ansys_node_num if available)

Now every node has its ID displayed on screen!

💥 Step 3: Show Deformation
To visualize the vibrational mode shape:

Filters → Warp By Vector → Click Apply

This uses "Nodal Solution" (or "Nodal Solution 0") to displace the mesh

You’ll now see a 3D deformation shape

You can scale the deformation if it’s tiny:

In the Warp filter settings: change Scale Factor (e.g. 10x, 100x)

🌈 Step 4: Add a Color Map
To color the displacement field:

In Color By dropdown, choose "Nodal Solution" or "Nodal Solution 0"

Set the component (X, Y, Z or magnitude)

Click Rescale to Data Range

▶️ Step 5: Animate the Mode
Go to View > Animation View

Add a Camera Orbit or Warp scaling sweep

Hit Play (bottom toolbar) to animate mode shape

You can also loop the deformation in Python/ParaView script if needed.
