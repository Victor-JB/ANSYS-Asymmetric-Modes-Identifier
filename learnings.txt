The .vtk file created by mapdl.result.save_as_vtk(...) is an unstructured grid containing:

📌 Nodal positions (the mesh)
🧭 Vector fields like nodal displacement
🎨 Scalar fields like node number, magnitude of displacement
🧠 Metadata about elements and node IDs

Yes, VTK files contain meshing information. 
They store the geometry (point coordinates) and topology (connectivity of elements) of a mesh. 
Essentially, a VTK file defines how a mesh is structured, including the arrangement of points 
and how they are connected to form elements like triangles, tetrahedra, etc. 

It's designed for use in:

ParaView (visualization)

PyVista / VTK in Python (manipulation)

Machine learning pipelines (as NumPy arrays)

4. Manipulating .vtk in ParaView – Quick Tips
Once you open a mode shape .vtk:

// PARAVIEW FILTERS
🔧 Useful Filters
Filter	Purpose
Warp By Vector	Visualize mode shape deformation
Calculator	Compute magnitude, apply math ops
Clip / Slice	View interior or mirror planes
Glyph	Show vector arrows (displacement)
Extract Points	Export points as CSV/VTK subset

// MODAL REACTION FORCE
What You Actually Want: Modal Reaction Force at Beam End
Since you're interested in:
💡 “How much force does the beam deliver to the object it’s embedded in when vibrating?”
You want to compute:
The reaction force at one or both ends
In response to a unit modal displacement scaled by a known amplitude

HOW TO PROPERLY RENDER VTK
Step 2: See the Mesh
To show the actual mesh triangulation:

In the top toolbar, click “Wireframe” from the dropdown (next to Surface)

Or go to the Properties panel, find Representation → set to Wireframe

You’ll now see the finite element grid

✅ This shows:

Element density (from meshing)

Node connectivity

Triangulation (for surface plots)

How complex your model was discretized

🧠 Optional: Show Node Numbers
In Properties panel, scroll to “Labels”

Check “Point Labels”

From the dropdown, select Point ID (or ansys_node_num if available)

Now every node has its ID displayed on screen!

💥 Step 3: Show Deformation
To visualize the vibrational mode shape:

Filters → Warp By Vector → Click Apply

This uses "Nodal Solution" (or "Nodal Solution 0") to displace the mesh

You’ll now see a 3D deformation shape

You can scale the deformation if it’s tiny:

In the Warp filter settings: change Scale Factor (e.g. 10x, 100x)

🌈 Step 4: Add a Color Map
To color the displacement field:

In Color By dropdown, choose "Nodal Solution" or "Nodal Solution 0"

Set the component (X, Y, Z or magnitude)

Click Rescale to Data Range

▶️ Step 5: Animate the Mode
Go to View > Animation View

Add a Camera Orbit or Warp scaling sweep

Hit Play (bottom toolbar) to animate mode shape

You can also loop the deformation in Python/ParaView script if needed.
