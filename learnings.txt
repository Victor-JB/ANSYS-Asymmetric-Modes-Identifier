The .vtk file created by mapdl.result.save_as_vtk(...) is an unstructured grid containing:

📌 Nodal positions (the mesh)

🧭 Vector fields like nodal displacement

🎨 Scalar fields like node number, magnitude of displacement

🧠 Metadata about elements and node IDs

It's designed for use in:

ParaView (visualization)

PyVista / VTK in Python (manipulation)

Machine learning pipelines (as NumPy arrays)

4. Manipulating .vtk in ParaView – Quick Tips
Once you open a mode shape .vtk:

// PARAVIEW FILTERS
🔧 Useful Filters
Filter	Purpose
Warp By Vector	Visualize mode shape deformation
Calculator	Compute magnitude, apply math ops
Clip / Slice	View interior or mirror planes
Glyph	Show vector arrows (displacement)
Extract Points	Export points as CSV/VTK subset

// MODAL REACTION FORCE
What You Actually Want: Modal Reaction Force at Beam End
Since you're interested in:

💡 “How much force does the beam deliver to the object it’s embedded in when vibrating?”

You want to compute:

The reaction force at one or both ends

In response to a unit modal displacement scaled by a known amplitude
