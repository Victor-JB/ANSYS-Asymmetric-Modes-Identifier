The .vtk file created by mapdl.result.save_as_vtk(...) is an unstructured grid containing:

ðŸ“Œ Nodal positions (the mesh)

ðŸ§­ Vector fields like nodal displacement

ðŸŽ¨ Scalar fields like node number, magnitude of displacement

ðŸ§  Metadata about elements and node IDs

It's designed for use in:

ParaView (visualization)

PyVista / VTK in Python (manipulation)

Machine learning pipelines (as NumPy arrays)

4. Manipulating .vtk in ParaView â€“ Quick Tips
Once you open a mode shape .vtk:

ðŸ”§ Useful Filters
Filter	Purpose
Warp By Vector	Visualize mode shape deformation
Calculator	Compute magnitude, apply math ops
Clip / Slice	View interior or mirror planes
Glyph	Show vector arrows (displacement)
Extract Points	Export points as CSV/VTK subset
