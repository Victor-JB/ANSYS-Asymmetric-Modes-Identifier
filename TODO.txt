Terminology:
"the physics of “pulsing” a McKibben from the inside to drive an asymmetric mode."


Next up:
- figure out how to parameterize the whole arm -- a cylinder
- new functions for beam_generator to generate new structures

For the material:
1. Adjust the tbdata values to match your actual silicone test data.

Add outer braided mesh simulation (for contraction behavior)
Run modal analysis on this flexible tube
Add internal pressure excitation (pneumatic inflation)

- possibly look into pre-built ParaView .pvsm session file that opens a mode and sets all this up automatically?

FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANALYZE FORCE GENERATED of a thing--HARMONIC ANALYSIS?

Figure out where to put vibrations, vibrating from the ends or from the middle (air excitation?)
- needed for force analysis

LOOK INTO SWITCHED NEURAL NETS FOR BETTER FUNCTION APPROXIMATION
LOOK INTO MULTITHREADING FOR CORES FOR SPEEDY SIMULATION!
 - Simulation time analysis, optimize and multithread for all of this

Parameterize for soft materials — dragon skin or other such materials
 - needed if parameterizing the arm itself to have asymmetric modes

 vibrate arm at 1 mode, curvature; vibrate arm at another mode, another curvature!
 - need heterogeneous structure

Parameterize with splines + different materials, most important right now

Discussed how it becomes a nonlinear optimization problem that we’re using Ansys for?
 
Parameterize the output of asymmetric modes once generated, use that format as the input to the neural net for it to find the structure
 - I give it an input arm parameterization, it gives me output; flip it for the NN

Qs:
Do I only need to include asymmetric modes in the dataset? Depends on ML inputs…
1. no, include both so the model has an idea; just test both

Figure out why I can’t open ansys workbench
How do I define my own cost function? I don’t think I need to more... nah just the ml

ANSWERS:
1. the input of the model is a paramterized beam of our design, parameterized according to my system
Would be cool to make a drawing gui through which the model could be interacted with--for funzies,
even make it text based??

Possibly modeling the entire arm; make a geometry and model all of the forces going on in the arm itself...
ALSO NEED TO VARY MATERIALS OF THE BEAM BEIND MODELED; BASICALLY, MODEL ALL PARAMETERS AND SEE HOW THE RESONANT FREQUENCY CHANGES
Research how to make a structure that bends more under excitation; curvature amplification

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt: In the create beam py file you gave me, I would like to explore a large space of all possible
material / structural combinations to get a thorough analysis of what materials and structures generate what kinds
of asymmetric modes, and have a full, thorough dataset of this for my model; how would it be possible to
systematically run through a bunch of simulations of different parameters (as in, run 1000 simulations of
steel material with 1000 different structures, with 1000 different parameter variations for the structure being simulated,
and get a large swath of the combination space and get a bunch of asymmetric mode examples over different
materials and structure combinations)?

I also need to check the space of all vibrational amplitudes and frequencies; just have the analysis do this
and compile it into a dataset

run_modal_basic.py (base file):
Runs a modal analysis on one beam, extracts frequency, and saves the mode shape as a .vtk.

🔹 beam_generator.py:
Builds beams of variable size (parametric generation).

🔹 modal_analysis.py:
Handles solving and postprocessing (mode shapes + frequencies).

🔹 symmetry_check.py:
Uses NumPy to classify whether a mode is symmetric or asymmetric.

🔹 dataset_builder.py (later):
Loops through beams and builds a dataset.

For force
🧠 Extract asymmetric mode shape
💥 Run harmonic or static analysis to get actual deformation + force output
🧠 Use this for your machine learning dataset
