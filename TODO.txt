Next up:
- See the mesh
- Figure out how to clamp ends
- figure out how to parameterize the whole arm

- possibly look into pre-built ParaView .pvsm session file that opens a mode and sets all this up automatically?

FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANALYZE FORCE GENERATED of a thing--HARMONIC ANALYSIS?

Figure out where to put vibrations, vibrating from the ends or from the middle (air excitation?)
- needed for force analysis

LOOK INTO SWITCHED NEURAL NETS FOR BETTER FUNCTION APPROXIMATION
LOOK INTO MULTITHREADING FOR CORES FOR SPEEDY SIMULATION!
 - Simulation time analysis, optimize and multithread for all of this

Parameterize for soft materials â€” dragon skin or other such materials
 - needed if parameterizing the arm itself to have asymmetric modes

 vibrate arm at 1 mode, curvature; vibrate arm at another mode, another curvature!
 - need heterogeneous structure

Visualize mesh of thing

Parameterize with splines + different materials, most important right now

Discussed how it becomes a nonlinear optimization problem that weâ€™re using Ansys for?
 
Parameterize the output of asymmetric modes once generated, use that format as the input to the neural net for it to find the structure
 - I give it an input arm parameterization, it gives me output; flip it for the NN

Qs:
Do I only need to include asymmetric modes in the dataset? Depends on ML inputsâ€¦
1. no, include both so the model has an idea; just test both

Figure out why I canâ€™t open ansys workbench
How do I define my own cost function? I donâ€™t think I need to more... nah just the ml

ANSWERS:
1. the input of the model is a paramterized beam of our design, parameterized according to my system
Would be cool to make a drawing gui through which the model could be interacted with--for funzies,
even make it text based??

Possibly modeling the entire arm; make a geometry and model all of the forces going on in the arm itself...
ALSO NEED TO VARY MATERIALS OF THE BEAM BEIND MODELED; BASICALLY, MODEL ALL PARAMETERS AND SEE HOW THE RESONANT FREQUENCY CHANGES
Research how to make a structure that bends more under excitation; curvature amplification

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt: In the create beam py file you gave me, I would like to explore a large space of all possible
material / structural combinations to get a thorough analysis of what materials and structures generate what kinds
of asymmetric modes, and have a full, thorough dataset of this for my model; how would it be possible to
systematically run through a bunch of simulations of different parameters (as in, run 1000 simulations of
steel material with 1000 different structures, with 1000 different parameter variations for the structure being simulated,
and get a large swath of the combination space and get a bunch of asymmetric mode examples over different
materials and structure combinations)?

I also need to check the space of all vibrational amplitudes and frequencies; just have the analysis do this
and compile it into a dataset

run_modal_basic.py (base file):
Runs a modal analysis on one beam, extracts frequency, and saves the mode shape as a .vtk.

ðŸ”¹ beam_generator.py:
Builds beams of variable size (parametric generation).

ðŸ”¹ modal_analysis.py:
Handles solving and postprocessing (mode shapes + frequencies).

ðŸ”¹ symmetry_check.py:
Uses NumPy to classify whether a mode is symmetric or asymmetric.

ðŸ”¹ dataset_builder.py (later):
Loops through beams and builds a dataset.

For force
ðŸ§  Extract asymmetric mode shape
ðŸ’¥ Run harmonic or static analysis to get actual deformation + force output
ðŸ§  Use this for your machine learning dataset
