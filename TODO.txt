BE ABLE TO PARAMETERIZE THE STUFF--super important for repeated sim
FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANALYZE FORCE GENERATED of a thing--HARMONIC ANALYSIS?
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT IN DATASET FOR ML--HOW TO ACTUALLY TRAIN A THING, the inputs and outputs
Figure out where to put vibrations, vibrating from the ends or from the middle (air excitation?)

Possibly modeling the entire arm; make a geometry and model all of the forces going on in the arm itself...
ALSO NEED TO VARY MATERIALS OF THE BEAM BEIND MODELED; BASICALLY, MODEL ALL PARAMETERS AND SEE HOW THE RESONANT FREQUENCY CHANGES
Research how to make a structure that bends more under excitation; curvature amplification

Prompt: In the create beam py file you gave me, I would like to explore a large space of all possible
material / structural combinations to get a thorough analysis of what materials and structures generate what kinds
of asymmetric modes, and have a full, thorough dataset of this for my model; how would it be possible to
systematically run through a bunch of simulations of different parameters (as in, run 1000 simulations of
steel material with 1000 different structures, with 1000 different parameter variations for the structure being simulated,
and get a large swath of the combination space and get a bunch of asymmetric mode examples over different
materials and structure combinations)?

I also need to check the space of all vibrational amplitudes and frequencies; just have the analysis do this
and compile it into a dataset

run_modal_basic.py (base file):
Runs a modal analysis on one beam, extracts frequency, and saves the mode shape as a .vtk.

ðŸ”¹ beam_generator.py:
Builds beams of variable size (parametric generation).

ðŸ”¹ modal_analysis.py:
Handles solving and postprocessing (mode shapes + frequencies).

ðŸ”¹ symmetry_check.py:
Uses NumPy to classify whether a mode is symmetric or asymmetric.

ðŸ”¹ dataset_builder.py (later):
Loops through beams and builds a dataset.


ðŸ§  Extract asymmetric mode shape
ðŸ’¥ Run harmonic or static analysis to get actual deformation + force output
ðŸ§  Use this for your machine learning dataset
