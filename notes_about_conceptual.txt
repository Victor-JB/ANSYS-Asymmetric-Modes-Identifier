3. Physical soundness of “pulsing” internal pressure to hit an asymmetric mode
Symmetry of excitation
A uniform internal pressure oscillation (purely radial, the same everywhere inside) 
will primarily excite the breathing modes (circumferential expansion/contraction) and 
the axial “bar” modes. By itself, it will not couple into a bending‐ or asymmetric mode unless:

you have geometric asymmetry (e.g., braided mesh pattern, cutouts), or

your boundary conditions break symmetry (one end fixed, the other free, slight pre‐bend).

Prestress & mode splitting
If you take the static inflated state and then do a prestress modal, the hoop tension raises 
the breathing‐mode frequencies, and also shifts the bending modes. You could see mode‐splitting 
(degenerate bending directions splitting apart) if your preload is asymmetric.

Practical forcing
To actively excite an asymmetric bending mode, you’d typically apply an off‐center internal jet, 
or mount the actuator so that its inertial coupling is asymmetric. Pure uniform pressure pulses 
tend to drive only the axisymmetric modes.

Notes:
- applying excitation symmetrically throughout a single muscle will not have it deform asymmetrically,
just will excite breahting modes axisymmetrically
- can apply off-axis pressure jet to have it deform and bend asymmetrically
- perhaps feasability of exciting the arm itself to find modes is not ideal
